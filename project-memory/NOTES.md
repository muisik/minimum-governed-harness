# Notes

Task details, rationale, decisions, requirements, and risks.

## TASK-0001 — Publish ContextRail v0.5 clean template distribution
- Status: completed
- Related: DEC-0002, DEC-0003
- Last updated: 2026-07-01

### Result

The clean payload, v0.5 operating contract, required-field validation, minimal template CI, source-repository parity CI, documentation, and publication workflow were implemented and passed all three operating-system jobs.

## TASK-0002 — Add synchronized template and release distribution
- Status: completed
- Related: DEC-0004
- Last updated: 2026-07-01

### Context

The Template Repository is the correct new-project installation channel, while GitHub Releases provide immutable versions, release notes, checksums, and a clean archive for existing or manually installed projects. Maintaining them as independent outputs would create drift risk.

### Decisions

A gated release workflow derives every output from `template/`, synchronizes the published template when needed, verifies a fresh clone, builds a clean ZIP, extracts and compares it, then creates the GitHub Release with checksum and file-manifest assets.

### Requirements

- The release target must be contained in `main`.
- `vX.Y.Z`, `template/.contextrail-version`, and the changelog heading must agree.
- Same-version source and published payloads must compare equal in normal CI.
- The release must not be created before fresh-clone and archive round-trip verification succeeds.
- The template repository may be updated only with `CONTEXTRAIL_TEMPLATE_TOKEN`.

### Result

Pull-request CI passed Linux, macOS, Windows, and published-template consistency checks. The merge marker started the gated workflow, which created `v0.5.0` only after source/template, fresh-clone, and extracted-archive equality gates. The official release path now publishes the clean ZIP, archive checksum, and per-file checksum manifest from the same canonical payload.

## TASK-0003 — Add handoff adoption and task-linked code trace
- Status: completed
- Related: DEC-0005, DEC-0006
- Last updated: 2026-07-01

### Context

ContextRail governed project-local work after it entered the repository, but it did not define how an external specification, assessment, or handoff package became local Board and Notes records. Source code and principal tests also had no minimal pointer back to the task context that explained why a durable behavior boundary existed.

### Decisions

- Add one generic `handoffs/HANDOFF.md` intake contract. External packages remain staging inputs and are converted into local records before implementation.
- Add a language-native code comment containing `ContextRail: TASK-####` and a short current invariant at the smallest useful implementation boundary.
- Reuse the same task marker in the principal regression test when a task establishes or changes testable runtime behavior.
- Do not create a separate implementation mapping file, semantic retrieval layer, region marker system, or full code-change history.

### Requirements

- Handoff adoption searches and deduplicates before creating local identities.
- Durable requirements, decisions, risks, rationale, acceptance criteria, and source provenance are captured in Notes.
- Independently verifiable implementation work is represented as short local Board tasks.
- Raw handoff packages do not become canonical project memory.
- Code trace markers resolve to a task with a lifecycle record and Notes detail.
- Exact duplicate task, decision, requirement, or risk titles under different identities are rejected after normalization.
- Linux, macOS, and Windows validators implement the same checks.

### Result

The clean template now includes generic handoff staging and adoption guidance, task-linked code trace rules, positive implementation/test mapping fixtures, and cross-platform validators for title identity, orphan records, code-pointer integrity, and nearby invariant text. Pull-request Actions run `28544540035` passed all validation and exact failure-assertion steps on Linux, macOS, and Windows, along with the published-template version guard.

## TASK-0004 — Harden published version synchronization
- Status: completed
- Related: DEC-0004
- Last updated: 2026-07-01

### Context

The first `v1.0.0` release attempt correctly synchronized the visible template payload but the mirror commit retained `.contextrail-version` as `0.5.0`. Fresh-clone equality verification blocked tag and release creation, proving the safety gate worked but exposing a staging gap for the hidden version file.

### Requirements

- Copy and force-stage `.contextrail-version` after payload synchronization.
- Verify the published worktree and staged blob both equal the declared release version before commit and push.
- Preserve the existing fresh-clone and archive round-trip gates.
- Re-run the same `v1.0.0` release only after pull-request validation succeeds.

### Result

The release workflow now explicitly installs and stages the version file, verifies both worktree and staged values, and confirms the fresh clone declares the requested release version. Pull-request Actions run `28545034563` passed Linux, macOS, Windows, and the published-template version guard.

## TASK-0005 — Add governed agent delegation policy
- Status: completed
- Related: DEC-0007
- Last updated: 2026-08-14

### Context

Modern coding environments may expose native subagents, worker agents, or multiple capability tiers. ContextRail should let a strong primary agent offload bounded mechanical or read-heavy work without making the user coordinate routine delegation, without allowing cheaper workers to make durable project decisions, and without turning ContextRail into a model router or multi-agent runtime.

### Requirements

- Keep the primary agent responsible for ambiguous requirements, architecture and domain decisions, security boundaries, destructive or data-risk operations, integration, independent review, and completion.
- Permit delegation only for bounded, low-blast-radius, objectively verifiable work with explicit scope, acceptance criteria, verification evidence, and stop conditions.
- Prefer zero or one focused worker for normal work and prevent overlapping writers unless the environment provides safe isolation.
- Keep lifecycle records and canonical project-memory integration under primary-agent ownership unless explicitly delegated.
- Treat worker output as untrusted until the primary agent inspects and verifies the actual result.
- Remain provider- and model-independent.
- Never authorize metered pay-as-you-go models, purchased credits, or external paid APIs without explicit user authorization.
- When no suitable native worker exists, allow a concise copy-paste delegation brief only when the expected savings are material.

### Result

ContextRail `v1.1.0` was published from the canonical `template/` payload. Main distribution validation run `31808775511` passed, release workflow run `31808775525` synchronized and round-trip verified the clean template mirror, and the GitHub Release published the ZIP, archive checksum, and per-file checksum manifest. The mirror now declares `.contextrail-version` `1.1.0`.

## TASK-0006 — Add reuse-first engineering policy
- Status: completed
- Related: DEC-0008
- Last updated: 2026-08-16

### Context

For non-trivial engineering work, starting from a custom implementation can waste time and create avoidable maintenance when a proven standard capability, official interface, maintained open-source component, or compatible existing system already solves the commodity part of the problem. Reuse must still preserve project independence, license compatibility, security boundaries, and a practical replacement path.

### Requirements

- Require proportional ecosystem research before substantial custom implementation when a proven existing solution is reasonably likely.
- Prefer standards, official APIs/SDKs/protocols, maintained open-source components, and compatible existing systems when they materially satisfy the requirement.
- Evaluate functional fit, maintenance, security, license compatibility, portability, operational constraints, and replacement cost before adoption.
- Incorporate external implementation code only when its license and terms are compatible with the project's intended use and distribution.
- Allow incompatible sources to inform documented behavior, interfaces, architecture, failure modes, and tradeoffs while requiring independent implementation rather than copying, close translation, or line-by-line ports.
- Keep replaceable third-party capability behind small project-owned boundaries when practical.
- Prefer upstream use over unnecessary forks and keep justified fork or vendored deltas small and documented.
- Keep research proportional; small or settled work must not expand into broad ecosystem surveys.

### Result

ContextRail `v1.3.0` adds a general reuse-first engineering section to the canonical agent contract and documents the same governance boundary without naming any project, product, provider, runtime, or application-specific implementation. Validator schemas and lifecycle formats are unchanged.

## DEC-0001 — Separate current truth, work, rationale, and evidence
- Status: accepted
- Related: TASK-0000
- Last updated: 2026-07-01
- Reflected in: project-memory/SYSTEM.md — Boundaries and Sources of Truth

### Decision

Use `SYSTEM.md`, `BOARD.md`, `NOTES.md`, and `HISTORY.md` as four bounded information roles.

## DEC-0002 — Maintain one canonical template payload
- Status: accepted
- Related: TASK-0001
- Last updated: 2026-07-01
- Reflected in: project-memory/SYSTEM.md — Components, Primary Flows, and Invariants

### Decision

Maintain reusable files only under `template/`. Treat `isikmuhamm/contextrail-template` as a published mirror rather than a separate development source.

## DEC-0003 — Integrate memory validation into canonical project verification
- Status: accepted
- Related: TASK-0001
- Last updated: 2026-07-01
- Reflected in: project-memory/SYSTEM.md — Invariants

### Decision

On first substantive use, discover the repository's existing native verification entrypoint and add ContextRail validation to the same canonical command. Use the standalone template workflow only as an initial safety net or when no established CI exists.

## DEC-0004 — Derive template and releases from one verified payload
- Status: accepted
- Related: TASK-0002, TASK-0004
- Last updated: 2026-07-01
- Reflected in: project-memory/SYSTEM.md — Primary Flows and Invariants

### Decision

Keep the GitHub Template Repository as the new-project channel and publish versioned clean ZIP archives from the same `template/` payload. Block release creation unless source, published mirror, and extracted archive are identical.

## DEC-0005 — Adopt external handoffs through local records
- Status: accepted
- Related: TASK-0003
- Last updated: 2026-07-01
- Reflected in: project-memory/SYSTEM.md — Components, Primary Flows, Boundaries and Sources of Truth, and Invariants

### Decision

Treat external handoff packages as non-canonical staging inputs. Before implementation, deduplicate them against current project memory and convert durable meaning into local Notes records and independently verifiable local Board tasks.

## DEC-0006 — Trace durable code boundaries to one governing task
- Status: accepted
- Related: TASK-0003
- Last updated: 2026-07-01
- Reflected in: project-memory/SYSTEM.md — Primary Flows, Invariants, and Known Limits

### Decision

Use a minimal language-native comment containing a local `TASK-####` pointer and short current invariant. The pointer identifies the task that best explains the present behavior, not every task that historically touched the code.

## DEC-0007 — Delegate bounded work without transferring ownership
- Status: accepted
- Related: TASK-0005
- Last updated: 2026-08-14
- Reflected in: project-memory/SYSTEM.md — Purpose and Scope, Components, Primary Flows, Boundaries and Sources of Truth, Invariants, and Known Limits

### Decision

Allow the primary coding agent to use native workers for bounded, low-risk, objectively verifiable work while retaining durable project judgment, canonical-memory integration, independent review, completion authority, and control over any paid external usage. ContextRail specifies the boundary but does not choose providers, models, or implement a multi-agent runtime.

## DEC-0008 — Prefer proven integration before custom implementation
- Status: accepted
- Related: TASK-0006
- Last updated: 2026-08-16
- Reflected in: project-memory/SYSTEM.md — Purpose and Scope, Primary Flows, Invariants, and Known Limits

### Decision

For non-trivial capabilities likely to have proven existing solutions, require proportional research before bespoke implementation. Prefer compatible reuse or integration, incorporate code only under compatible terms, use incompatible sources only as engineering knowledge for an independent implementation, keep replaceable dependencies behind small project-owned boundaries, and treat substantial custom infrastructure as a decision that requires justification rather than the default starting point.
